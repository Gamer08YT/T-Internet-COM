#  Function
1. Connect to the `Ethernet`. Through the AP function of ESP32, the accessory device can be connected. You can also use a mobile phone to connect to make it function as a router.
2. Connect the `4G module` and the SIM card that can access the Internet, and enable other devices to access the network through WiFi-AP function forwarding.
3. The back of the bottom board is equipped with an SD card socket, which can be connected to an SD card or use this set of SPI to read data from other sensors, or it can be used as a normal IO.
